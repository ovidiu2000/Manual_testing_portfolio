## 1.1 Test Planning
The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the Add Employee module from the OrangeHRM application. 
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

#### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined
* ensuring all critical Test Cases are passed
* achieving complete Functional Coverage
* identifying and fixing all the high-priority defects
* re-testing and closing all the high-priority defects to execute corresponding Regression Testing successfully

#### 1.1.4 Test scope
* Tests in scope: all the feature of Add Employee module which were defined in software requirement specs need to be tested: functional testing, GUI testing and API testing 
*  Tests not in scope: compatibility testing on a mobile environment, performance testing, integration with other modules

#### 1.1.5 Risks detected
* lack of experience of the QA team, short deadline of Zephyr Squad trial, unavailability of test environment

#### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

## 1.3 Test Analysis
The testing procces will be executed base on the aproved documentation for the "Employee List" module and the folowing text condition need to be met:
* Create an employee entry by introducing data only in the mandatory fields and check if the employee is created.
* Create an employee entry by introducing data in all the fields and check if the employee is created.
* Leave mandatory fields empty and check that the employee cannot be created or updated.
* Check all validation constraints for the fields
* Check that pictures can be added to the profile when the entry is created. Update the entry with a picture.
